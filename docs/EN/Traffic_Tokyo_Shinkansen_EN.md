## Transportation
### Tokyo Shinkansen
#### Fares
Shinkansen fares are expensive, but flexibility, comfort and speed are optimal.
Since there is no Shinkansen station in Aizu, you need to take a bus/train to get to a Shinkansen station.
The nearest Shinkansen station is Koriyama Station in Koriyama.

Early bird tickets also exist for the Shinkansen, with discounts ranging from 30% to 95%. Please use the Ekinet ticketing system.

Fares vary depending on where you get off. The default drop-off point is Tokyo Station.

**Purchase Tickets** 
1. Purchase tickets online through Ekinet (only for JR East Shinkansen and limited express trains).
The URL is: https://www.eki-net.com/personal/top/index.html
Ekinet also supports the Suica card, which allows you to ride the Shinkansen directly through Suica.

2. Purchasing tickets offline.
Although there is no Shinkansen at Aizuwakamatsu Station, you can still buy Shinkansen tickets at the station's ticketing machines. If in doubt, you can also ask at the ticket counter.

PS: Aizu University students receive a student discount. For more information, contact the Aizu University SAD.
