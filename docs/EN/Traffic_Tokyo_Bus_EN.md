### Tokyo High Speed Bus
#### Fares
Buses are the cheapest way to get to Tokyo, but they take about 4-5 hours.
Currently (2024-01-10), Aizu-Tokyo bus fares are based on a floating calendar price.
![Ticket Prices](../images/AizuBusTokyoPrice.png "Ticket Price List")
Regular Bus tickets are categorized into S, A, and B. Generally speaking, consecutive holidays with holidays are S, regular weekends are A, and weekdays are B.
Early Bird Bus tickets are also categorized into S, A, and B, but they are less expensive, with discounts reaching about 60%.
Tips about Early Bird Tickets:

1. The number of Early Bird Tickets is limited and tickets are usually opened one month in advance. Please check the ticketing website around one month in advance to check if they are available for purchase. The refresh time for purchasing tickets is 10:00 every day.
For example, if you wish to purchase tickets for February 10th, you should check the ticketing website at 10:00 on January 09th to check if they are available.

#### Ticketing
Ticketing website in Japanese: https://www.kousokubus.net/BusRsv/ja/
English-Korean-Simplified Chinese-Traditional Chinese ticketing website: https://www.kousokubus.net/JpnBus/en
The ticketing website has detailed procedures for purchasing tickets, so I won't repeat them here.
The Tokyo Line is the only one of Aizu's common highway bus routes that requires advance ticketing, and is operated on a "reservation system". If you forget to buy a ticket or buy a ticket on the wrong day, you can talk to the conductor, and there are usually seats available on the bus, so you can buy a ticket and get on the bus.
Tickets can also be purchased at the Aizu Bus Terminal and Shinjuku Bus Terminal ticket counters.

#### Aizu → Tokyo/Shinjuku
##### Stations
In Aizuwakamatsu City, there are two boarding points: Aizuwakamatsu Ekimae Bus Terminal and Aizuwakamatsu Apio.
Please note that unlike other highway bus routes, the "Kitayanagahara" and "Tsuruga Castle/Engineering Office Building" stops are not included in the boarding and alighting area of the Tokyo Line.
* Aizu Station Bus Terminal
Please note that the Aizu Ekimae Bus Terminal is not the same place as the Aizu-Wakamatsu Ekimae (Aizu-Wakamatsu JR Station) where you get off.

##### Ride the bus
* :: Waiting for the Bus
Please arrive at the Bus stop early and wait for the Bus to arrive. However, you usually don't have to worry about the bus leaving early (but it may step off, so please be sure to arrive early). Due to traffic, the bus to Aizuwakamatsu Apio is 5-10 minutes late in most cases during rush hour. However, buses to the bus terminal in front of Aizuwakamatsu Station are usually not late. Please be patient.

* Luggage
Suitcases and large luggage can be placed in the storage area under the special vehicle. The driver will help you to open the door of the storage area before boarding the bus, and sometimes you need to place them by yourself, sometimes the driver will help you.
Usually 2 large suitcases can be put down during busy non-holiday periods.
Normal backpacks and carry-on bags can be brought on board.

* Getting on the bus
When you finish purchasing your ticket, you will receive an email that you need to have the driver/machine scan the QR code, so please prepare it in advance. A PDF file for printing or a web page is fine. In some cases, you may only need to show the PDF file or web page.
When you get on the bus, please sit down according to the seat number you chose when you purchased the ticket. Fasten your seat belt.

* While traveling
Please be aware that you need to be quiet while traveling on buses in Japan, so please do not disturb other people.
Most buses provide free WiFi and charging ports. (However, because of the different models, some things require plugs and some are USB ports)

* SA/PA Service Area
There are two SA/PA stops on the Tokyo line, [Abukuma PA] and [Hasei SA].
However, the typical stop is only 8-15 minutes (depending on traffic), and it's usually time to use the restroom and purchase food. It is almost unlikely that you will be able to eat in the service area.
Please don't miss the Bus.
PS: Abukuma PA is currently (07/28/2023) closed for all stores, only toilets and vending machines.

* Getting off the train
There are three drop-off points on the Tokyo Line: [Oji Station], [Ikebukuro Station] and [Shinjuku].
The fare is the same no matter where you get off, so please don't worry.
When you get close to the drop-off point, the car will announce a voice, when the voice is almost finished, press the button to tell the driver that someone wants to get off, then the driver will stop the car. Because the Tokyo line is quite busy, the button is pressed in most cases. The button only needs to be pressed by someone, so there is no need to press it repeatedly. Please don't press the button too early either, it will make the driver think there is an emergency.
When the bus stops, then unbuckle your seatbelt, take your luggage, and get off the bus. The aisles are narrow, so please be courteous.
If you are carrying a paper ticket, then please give it to the driver before getting off the bus.
**Oji Station**
This is a stop in northern Tokyo. If you are planning to go to [Akabane], [Saitama], etc., you can choose to get off here.
If you wish to get to Shinjuku or other places quickly, you can get off at Oji Station and take the JR line to get there, as the BUS takes the surface road and will travel slower and longer due to traffic lights and traffic jams. Passengers with severe motion sickness should consider getting off at Oji Station and then taking another form of transportation to your destination.
Also, if you are traveling to Haneda Airport, it is faster to get off at Oji Station and take a train to Haneda Airport.
Please refer to the article [Getting to Haneda Airport].
**Ikebukuro Station***
Please note that Ikebukuro Station only has a drop-off point, not a boarding point.
**Shinjuku Station
Shinjuku Station is a large transportation hub in Tokyo where you can take JR, subway, and buses. Passengers who are traveling to Tokyo for the first time or are unfamiliar with the city may choose to get off here. There is also a passenger service center here where you can inquire about routes, purchase subway cards, etc.
**Tokyo Station**
This route is suspended.

#### Tokyo/Shinjuku → Aizu
##### Stations
There are two boarding points for buses in Tokyo: Shinjuku Bus Terminal and Oji Station.
Please note that there is no boarding point at Ikebukuro Station on the Tokyo/Aizu route.
* Shinjuku Bus Terminal
Among the waiting areas for BusTerminal, the boarding area for Aizu is Area A, but it may change. Please check and confirm the BusTerminal waiting area before boarding.

* Prince Station
The bus stop at Oji Station is not located in the bus area adjacent to the JR station, but is about a 3-minute walk away.
https://goo.gl/maps/4szJ7wUKEggccbR27
Please note that there are many routes to this highway bus ride point, so please do not get on the wrong bus.
Also, because of the traffic congestion in Tokyo, there is usually a 15-minute delay in arrival time at Oji Station. If it's rush hour, it can even reach 30 minutes. There are also a few cases where the Bus will arrive earlier.
However, you still need to arrive early to take the bus, but you don't need to be anxious because the Bus is late.

When you get close to the drop-off point, the bus will announce a voice, and when the voice is almost finished, you can press the button to tell the driver that someone wants to get off, and then the driver will stop the bus.

The drop-off point is here:
